<h1>More About Me</h1>
 <hr>

 <p>My name is Marquis D. Buckley a Navy veteran, soon-to-be Computer Science graduate, and someone who’s deeply 
    committed to growth, purpose, and people. 
    I’m currently a senior at Texas Southern University with a 3.77 GPA, expected to graduate in December 2026. 
    I’ve always had a drive to lead, to build, and to contribute whether that was maintaining mission-critical 
    fuel systems aboard Navy ships or writing code to bring ideas to life.
</p>

<p>
    For eight years, I served in the U.S. Navy where I managed operations under pressure, led a 50-member crew, 
    and learned what it really means to be accountable. That time shaped me not just professionally, but personally. 
    It taught me resilience, clarity under stress, and the power of showing up fully, even when things get tough.

<p>
    When I left the military, I knew I wanted to reinvent myself not just take a job, 
    but discover something that could challenge my mind and fuel my creativity. That's where tech came in. 
    I’ve since built websites, designed databases, and started using technology as a tool for progress. 
    I love seeing ideas become real through code and I'm always eager to learn more.
</p>

<p>
    Outside of school and work, I’m someone who values genuine conversation, creative thinking, and good energy. 
    I believe in building things that matter and surrounding myself with people who are bold enough to chase more 
    for themselves too. If you’re looking to collaborate, network, 
    or just connect on something meaningful, I’d love to meet you.
